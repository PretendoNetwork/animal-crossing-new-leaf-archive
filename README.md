# Animal Crossing: New Leaf Archive

Website for displaying the data from the [Animal Crossing: New Leaf Archive](https://archive.org/details/animal-crossing-new-leaf-dream-suite-archive). ***Not currently hosted, very WIP!***

## TODO

Currently only a subset of data is shown on the website. Additional data is likely inside the town data itself, however the structure of the town files is not currently known.

- [ ] Home page (implemented, but very basic. Lacks design)
- [x] Town list API
- [x] Town info API
- [x] Town list page
- [ ] Town info page (implemented, but very basic. Lacks design)
  - [x] Town name
  - [x] Town uploader
  - [x] Town upload date
  - [x] Town update date
  - [x] Town last visit date
  - [x] Town visits
  - [x] Town villagers list
  - [x] Town versions list
  - [ ] Town fruit
  - [ ] Town map
  - [ ] Town flag

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
